Elixir Installation
===================

Elixir is too good to miss out on but installing it on Ubuntu takes more than one command...which is where this script comes in.

Just run:
`curl -L https://raw.github.com/AdamWhittingham/install-elixir/master/install.sh | bash -s`

Options
-------
The version installed can be overridden by providing it at the end of the command.

For example, to choose to install 0.10.0
`curl -L https://raw.github.com/AdamWhittingham/install-elixir/master/install.sh | bash -s 0.10.0`

ToDo
----
* Work out the latest tag on Elixir-lang and pull that instead of a hardcoded value
